# SeleniumTest
Making simple Selenium tools to help me test websites

# Motivation
I want to learn Selenium better and the best way is to just do it. I've researched some common problems that Web Testers face and decided to try to make my life easier by making simple classes and methods that help me test web pages. 

# Build Status
At time of writing (9/19/18) I have a way to input multiple locators for a single webelement and try them in order of a predefined precedence (some locators are better than others). The first one that works is the one that is used. I also have a simple method that waits for a webelement to be available to click/display to eliminate those annoying Thread.sleep calls. I'm currently working on waiting for a webpage to load fully and being able to determine wether a given webelement causes a page to reload or not programatically.

# Code Style
Java, camelCase, Closing Brackets preferably on their own line unless the statement inside it can fit easily on one line

# Framework used
Java, IntelliJ IDE (community edition), Selenium Webdriver

# Tests
Schedueled but none implemented so far, just ad hoc testing

# Want to Contribute?
Not accepting pull requests, I want to be the only one changing my code. Open to code reviews, eager to learn.
